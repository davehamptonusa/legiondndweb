I grew up on the Jersey Shore in a little town called Little Silver who's big claim to fame is being one town over from where Bruce Springsteen lives. I am told he has since moved and we are devastated. I was an ocean lifeguard for 5 years and a competitive swimmer for 7. After college I got the itch for \"novelty prison break swims\" and since then have swam Alcatraz and the Chateau D'If. As a kid I was heavily influenced by a Liberty Science Center IMAX presentation on special effects, where they showed how they blew up the models in Independence Day. It's the reason I got into film & tv and the reason I try to include explosions in all my content. Running out of time so: 2-time Emmy Award winning digital team participation trophy recipient (which is a group photo with Carrot Top, not an Emmy), part time sketch comedy producer, full time cat daddy.",

As a kid my friends and I would play our own games of imagination in the woods and one summer we discovered GERPS-- I was obsessed. Unfortunately the kid who owned the books didn't go to my school so I never played again. It's awesome to be able to play with such a fun group of people, both vets who know the game inside and out and n00bs like me who can test the fences til they get shocked. I like to think I'm chaotic good even in real life.",
